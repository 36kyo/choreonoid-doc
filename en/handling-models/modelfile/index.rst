Model files
================

Ordinarily, the robots and environment models used in Choreonoid are generated by importing pre-written files into the program as Body items. These files include information on the model’s shape, color and other optical data, joint structure, physical parameters, sensor data, et cetera, and are called “model files.”

Model file formats are defined by the robot software system in use; Choreonoid currently supports the following formats by default:

* Body format model files (Body files)
* OpenHRP format model files

The current version of Choreonoid uses Body files as its default model files. Unless you have a specific reason to do so, you should use Body files.
