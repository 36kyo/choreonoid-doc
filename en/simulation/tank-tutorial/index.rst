   step4.rst
   step5.rst
   step6.rst

This tutorial presumes that the process is invoked on Ubuntu Linux, so you should endeavor to use the same OS. The source code itself will work on other operating systems, but as with Choreonoid itself, the compilation method may differ slightly.

.. note:: The project and source code files created in this tutorial are stored in the /sample/tutorial/Tank subdirectory of the Choreonoid source directory.
