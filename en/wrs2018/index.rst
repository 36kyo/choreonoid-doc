World Robot Summit 2018
=======================

At the robotics event `"World Robot Summit (WRS) 2018" <http://worldrobotsummit.org/>`_  held in October 2018, there was an event featuring a robotics competition in a virtual environment simulated by Choreonoid. This competition was one of the events held in the `infrastructure and disaster response category  <http://worldrobotsummit.org/wrc2018/disaster/>`_   under the title, “Tunnel Disaster Response and Recovery Challenge”. (`World Robot Challenge (WRC) 2018 <http://worldrobotsummit.org/wrc2018/guideline/>`_, a robotics competition consisting of four categories in total, was held at WRS.)

This document is a summary of the technical information required for participating in this event. The models and simulation settings required for the competition are included as Choreonoid samples, so anyone who did not participate in the competition can also try them out. These samples are useful in learning how to make practical use of Choreonoid.
