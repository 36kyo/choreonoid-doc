.. sectionauthor:: 中岡 慎一郎 <s.nakaoka@aist.go.jp>

We verify that the development version of Choreonoid (Version 1.5 candidate) operates on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu Linux 12.04, 14.04 (x64 architecture）

It is expected that Choreonoid operates in other Linux distributions, versions or architectures, but we have not officially verified the interoperability yet. It may not be possible to install Choreonoid just by following the instructions provided in this document.

As for Windows and Mac OS X, we have verified the interoperability with the released versions including 1.3 but we have not verified the interoperability with the latest development versions. Please refer to the manual of the released versions if you want to use the development version on Windows or Mac OS X.
