We have verified that Choreonoid version 1.6 operates on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu Linux 14.04, 16.04 (x64 architecture）

* Windows 7 (x64 architecture)

It is expected that Choreonoid operates in other Linux distributions, versions or architectures, but we have not officially verified the interoperability yet. It may not be possible to install Choreonoid just by following the instructions provided in this document.
